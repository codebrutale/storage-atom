(defprotocol IPartitioning
  "A set of operations that allows a value to be partitioned into two parts:
  the *storable* part that should be stored into the storage and *unstorable*
  part that shouldn't.  A typical target of the operations would be an
  application database.

  The operations are:

  - `split` (`[partitioning value]`): Splits `value` into a vector
    `[unstorable storable]`.

  - `join` (`[partitioning [unstorable storable]]`): Joins the vector
    `[unstorable storable]` back into a value representing the whole.

  An `IPartitioning` should always satisfy the following invariant for all
  meaningful values:

  ```
  (= (->> value
          (split partitioning)
          (join partitioning))
